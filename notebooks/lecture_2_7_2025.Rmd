# Classifiers

## Logistic Regression

```{r}
logistic.glm.plt = ggplot(Default, aes(x=balance, y = as.numeric(default) -1)) +geom_point()
logistic.glm.plt = logistic.glm.plt + 
  geom_smooth(method = glm, formula = y~x, method.args = list(family="binomial"))
print(logistic.glm.plt)
```

We have used `glm` instead of `lm` , and we have used `binomial` to set to logistic regression.

Getting the underlying classifier model:

```{r}
logistic.glm = glm(default~balance, data=Default, family = binomial)
```

```{r}
logistic.glm
```

The coefficients are the $\beta_0$ and the $\beta_1$ in the logistic model.

```{r}
summary(logistic.glm)
```

and we can get confidence intervals on the coefficients

```{r}
confint(logistic.glm)
```
